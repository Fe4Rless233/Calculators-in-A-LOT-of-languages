# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible so that we can address it. Please follow the steps below to report a vulnerability:

1. **Do not open an issue** in the repository for security vulnerabilities. Instead, please report it privately to the maintainers.
2. **Send an email** to [aklavyakumr@gmail.com](mailto:aklavyakumr@gmail.com) with the following information:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability and how it can be reproduced.
   - The affected version(s) of the repository.
   - Any additional information that can help us assess and fix the vulnerability.

We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and aim to resolve it promptly. We will also credit you for the report, unless you wish to remain anonymous.

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest release and the most recent stable version of each language-specific implementation. Security patches and important updates will be applied to these versions.

### Currently Supported Versions:
- Python: 3.x
- JavaScript (Node.js): 12.x and above
- Java: 8 and above
- Ruby: 2.5 and above
- Go: 1.16 and above
- Other languages: See individual language folders for version-specific details.

If you're using a specific version of the software and need a security patch, please open a discussion or report the issue privately to us.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

To ensure the security of the project and maintain best practices when contributing, we ask that all contributors follow these guidelines:

1. **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**: Do not include sensitive information like API keys, credentials, or tokens in your code or commits. Use environment variables or configuration files with proper security.
2. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input in your code. Be aware of security issues like injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, etc.).
3. **Error Handling**: Do not expose stack traces or detailed error messages in production environments. Proper error handling will prevent attackers from gaining insight into vulnerabilities.
4. **Use Dependencies Safely**: Ensure that any external dependencies are from trusted sources. Always check for the latest versions of dependencies and ensure they do not have known security vulnerabilities.
5. **Keep Your Fork Updated**: If you're working with a fork of this repository, regularly pull updates from the main repository to ensure you're working with the latest secure codebase.

## Security Updates

We will release security patches as necessary and update the repository with fixes as soon as possible. If a vulnerability is disclosed, we will:
- Investigate the vulnerability immediately.
- Release a security fix or patch.
- Notify contributors and users via a GitHub release note or a mailing list (if applicable).

## Secure Communication

When discussing vulnerabilities or reporting issues, we encourage you to use private and secure communication methods. You can reach out via email or use encrypted channels if necessary.
